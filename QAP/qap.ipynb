    "# Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we address the **Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)**, a classic and computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. QAP arises in various real-world scenarios, such as facility layout design, scheduling, and electronics design, where a set of facilities must be assigned to a set of locations in a way that minimizes the total cost, typically based on the distance and flow between the facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to solve QAP instances by implementing and evaluating a variety of **Local Search** and **Population-Based Search** algorithms. The solution process begins with algorithm development and is followed by experimental analysis using both small-scale and larger, more complex problem instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "The following families of metaheuristic algorithms will be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Search Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms iteratively explore the solution space by making small, localized changes to the current solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Improvement**  \n",
    "  Performs a neighborhood search and accepts the first neighboring solution that improves the current objective value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Improvement**  \n",
    "  Explores all neighboring solutions and selects the one with the best improvement (or least deterioration, in case of local optima escape).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabu Search**  \n",
    "  Enhances local search by using memory structures that describe the visited solutions or user-defined attributes, in order to avoid cycles and encourage exploration of new areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population-Based Search Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods maintain and evolve a population of candidate solutions over time, typically offering greater exploration capabilities than local search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**  \n",
    "  A probabilistic technique inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It uses pheromone trails to guide the search towards promising regions of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(μ + λ) Evolutionary Algorithm**  \n",
    "  A type of evolutionary strategy where μ parents generate λ offspring through variation operators (mutation, crossover), and the next generation is selected from the combined pool of parents and offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we load all the required libraries and modules necessary for the implementation of these algorithms. This includes standard libraries for numerical computation, data handling, and optimization, as well as custom modules for QAP-specific operations.\n"

    "## Problem Instance: 9-City Case\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our experimentation, we will use a simplified instance of the Quadratic Assignment Problem involving **9 cities**. This small-scale case provides a manageable context for developing, debugging, and evaluating the performance of our algorithms before scaling to larger instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We define two key matrices that model the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Matrix (`qap_costs_9`)**  \n",
    "  This matrix represents the cost associated with traveling from one city to another. Each entry `C[i][j]` indicates the cost incurred when assigning facility `i` to location `j`. These costs may encapsulate factors such as resource usage, traffic load, or economic penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance Matrix (`qap_distances_9`)**  \n",
    "  This matrix encodes the physical or logical distances between locations. Each element `D[i][j]` specifies the distance between location `i` and location `j`. In real-world analogs, this could reflect geographic distances, travel times, or network latencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the QAP is to determine an optimal assignment of facilities (cities) to locations that **minimizes the total cost**, which is calculated as the sum of the products of corresponding entries in the cost and distance matrices. Formally, the objective function is:\n",

    "- $D_{\\pi(i), \\pi(j)}$ is the distance between the locations assigned to facilities $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "- $\\pi$ is a permutation of the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ representing an assignment of facilities to locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This instance requires finding a permutation of the 9 cities such that the total weighted cost, combining both the flow and the distance, is minimized while visiting all cities exactly once."

    "\n",
    "## First Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **First Improvement** algorithm is a local search heuristic designed to explore the solution space efficiently by making incremental improvements to the current solution. Unlike exhaustive search methods that evaluate all possible solutions, First Improvement stops as soon as it finds the first solution that improves the current one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: First Improvement is computationally more efficient than exhaustive search algorithms because it does not require evaluating every possible neighbor. As soon as a better solution is found, the search proceeds to that neighbor.\n",
    "- **Local Optima**: While this method is fast, it has the potential downside of getting stuck in **local optima**. Since the algorithm only considers the first improving neighbor, it may miss opportunities for a global optimum by not exploring the entire neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm begins with an initial solution, which could be a random solution or a starting heuristic.\n",
    "2. **Neighbor Exploration**: All possible neighbors of the current solution are generated.\n",
    "3. **Improvement Check**: The algorithm evaluates each neighbor and accepts the first one that results in an improvement (i.e., a lower cost).\n",
    "4. **Termination**: The process stops when no improving neighbor can be found, indicating that a local optimum has been reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **Speed**: Since it halts as soon as a better solution is found, it is relatively fast compared to exhaustive search methods.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement, making it a good starting point for more complex optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- **Local Optima**: The First Improvement algorithm may stop prematurely, leading to a solution that is only a local optimum and not the best possible global solution.\n",
    "- **Limited Exploration**: By focusing only on the first improvement found, the algorithm may overlook better solutions that require more exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "Consider a scenario where we are solving the **Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)**. If our current solution is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and we find a neighbor `[0, 2, 1, 3, 4]` that improves the total cost, the algorithm will accept this neighbor and stop searching further in that iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy makes First Improvement a useful algorithm when **time efficiency** is more important than finding the absolute best solution. It can be particularly beneficial in **large-scale optimization problems**, where exhaustive search methods are not feasible due to time and computational limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",

    "## Tabu Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tabu Search** is an advanced optimization algorithm that builds on the concept of exploring the solution space iteratively while maintaining a list of prohibited moves, known as the \"tabu list\". This mechanism helps avoid revisiting previously explored solutions (thus preventing loops) and encourages diversity in the search process, which ultimately leads to more effective exploration of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm starts with an initial solution, which can be generated randomly or using another method.\n",
    "   - A tabu list is initialized to store recently visited solutions, and a best solution is tracked throughout the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploration of Neighbors**:\n",
    "   - In each iteration, the algorithm generates a set of neighboring solutions.\n",
    "   - It examines each neighbor and checks if it is in the tabu list (i.e., if it has been visited before). If a neighbor is not in the tabu list, it is considered for further evaluation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Selection of the Best Neighbor**:\n",
    "   - Among all valid neighbors (those not in the tabu list), the best one is selected based on the cost (the one with the lowest cost).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Tabu List Management**:\n",
    "   - The selected neighbor is then added to the tabu list to prevent revisiting it in future iterations.\n",
    "   - The size of the tabu list is managed by removing the oldest solutions once the list exceeds the specified size.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Updating the Best Solution**:\n",
    "   - If the newly selected neighbor is better than the current best solution (i.e., it has a lower cost), it is stored as the new best solution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - The process repeats for a specified number of iterations, or until a stopping condition (such as a set number of iterations) is met."

    "## Population Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Population search techniques, such as the **Ant Colony Algorithm** and the **Genetic Algorithm**, are widely used for solving combinatorial optimization problems like the **Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)**. These methods utilize a population of candidate solutions and evolve them over time to find better solutions. There are many variants and extensions of these algorithms that can be applied to QAP, depending on the specific problem requirements and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we will focus on one of the population-based approaches, specifically the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm, which is based on the behavior of ants exploring the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANTS (Ant Colony Optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of population search for QAP, the **Ant Colony Algorithm** leverages the behavior of ants, which are able to explore the solution space, discover promising solutions, and progressively improve the quality of the solutions through interaction with their environment. Ants communicate via pheromones, which are deposited on the paths they take. Over time, paths with more pheromones become more attractive to other ants, leading to the discovery of better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in implementing ACO for QAP is to create an **Ant** class. This class will include methods that allow each ant to simulate its behavior, such as exploring possible solutions, updating pheromones, and constructing solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ant Class Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Ant** class will include the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Each ant needs to be initialized with a set of parameters, such as its starting position, pheromone levels, and other necessary attributes.\n",
    "2. **Exploration**: Ants will explore the solution space by moving through different possible assignments of cities, evaluating the cost at each step.\n",
    "3. **Pheromone Update**: After completing its path, the ant will deposit pheromones on the cities it visited to guide future ants.\n",
    "4. **Solution Construction**: The ant constructs a solution based on the state of the pheromone trail and possibly other local search mechanisms."

    "## Evolution λ μ (Evolutionary Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Evolution λ μ** algorithm is a population-based search strategy used to solve combinatorial optimization problems like the **Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)**. It is based on evolutionary principles and operates through a process of **selection**, **crossover (or recombination)**, **mutation**, and **replacement**. The algorithm is designed to improve a population of solutions over multiple generations, progressively refining the solutions towards better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Evolution λ μ approach:\n",
    "- **λ (lambda)** represents the number of offspring (new solutions) generated in each generation.\n",
    "- **μ (mu)** represents the number of parents selected to produce the offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Evolution λ μ\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection**: A subset of the current population is selected as parents based on fitness, i.e., how good their solutions are. The selection process favors the selection of better solutions while maintaining some diversity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Crossover (Recombination)**: Two selected parents combine their features to create offspring. This is similar to how biological organisms inherit traits from both parents.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Mutation**: Some offspring undergo random changes to introduce variability. This helps the algorithm escape local optima and explore a wider range of possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Replacement**: The newly generated offspring replace a portion of the current population, depending on the specific replacement strategy. The goal is to progressively improve the population over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution λ μ Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to start with a population of random solutions, evaluate them, and apply selection, crossover, and mutation to create a new generation of solutions. Over multiple generations, the population improves, ultimately converging to a high-quality solution for the QAP.\n",

    "- **First Improvement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Efficient in time, since it looks for and applies the first movement that improves the current solution.\n",
    "        - You can quickly find acceptable solutions to problems with large search spaces.\n",
    "        - Because of its time execution, we can reach a great solution using a loop.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - You can get stuck at local optima without exploring the solution space in depth.\n",
    "        - It does not guarantee finding the best overall solution.  \n",

    "- **Best Improvement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Examines and selects the best available move in each iteration, which can lead to a more extensive search.\n",
    "        - It has a better chance of finding better solutions than the First Improvement algorithm.\n",
    "        - Because of its time execution, we can reach a great solution using a loop.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - It can still suffer from stagnation at local optima.\n",

    "- **Tabu Search**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - It avoids stagnation at local optima by using a tabu list that prohibits previous moves.\n",
    "        - Promotes diversity of solutions by exploring different neighborhoods and movements.\n",
    "        - You can find better quality solutions and get progressively better over time.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - It requires a mechanism to manage and update the tabu list, which can add complexity to the implementation.\n",
    "        - Requires longer execution time due to testing multiple neighborhoods, especially in the 35-cities case.\n",

    "- **Ants (Ant Colony Optimization)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Utilizes the ability of ants to explore the solution space and find promising solutions.\n",
    "        - Combines local and global information using pheromones to guide the search.\n",
    "        - Can find high-quality solutions and adapt to changes in the environment.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - It requires careful adjustment of parameters, such as the amount of pheromones and heuristic influence, to obtain good results.\n",
    "        - May require a longer execution time due to the iterative construction of solutions by the ants.\n",

    "- **Mu Lambda Evolution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Uses a population-based evolution strategy to find high-quality solutions.\n",
    "        - Combines selection, crossing, and mutation to generate new solutions and progressively improve the quality of the population.\n",
    "        - Can find high-quality or optimal solutions and adapt to different problems.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - Requires proper adjustment of parameters, such as the size of the λ and μ groups, to obtain a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "        - Requires longer run time due to handling and testing of entire populations, especially in the 35-cities case.\n"
