    "In this task, we will implement a **genetic algorithm (GA)**—a nature-inspired optimization technique modeled on the principles of natural selection and genetics. This algorithm iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions toward an optimal or near-optimal solution for a given problem.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The results demonstrate that the genetic algorithm effectively finds optimal solutions across both test cases, regardless of the problem size. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 1 (26 cities):**  \n",
    "  The algorithm successfully identified the optimal route in a relatively short time. Interestingly, the `(μ, λ)` strategy without recombination converged faster in this smaller instance, indicating that recombination might not always be necessary for simpler problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 2 (42 cities):**  \n",
    "  The algorithm also reached the optimal solution in this larger instance, showcasing the strength of the recombination operator. The inclusion of crossover (specifically, the Order Crossover method) played a crucial role in enhancing the search capability for this more complex scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations underline the importance of **parameter tuning**. Adjusting the values of `λ` (offspring size), `μ` (number of parents), and the number of generations is essential to balance **exploration** and **exploitation** within the algorithm. Proper tuning can significantly impact convergence speed and solution quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Recombination Before Mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying recombination before mutation in a genetic algorithm brings several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Exploration of the Search Space:**  \n",
    "   Recombination combines valuable traits from different individuals, generating offspring that may inherit the strengths of both parents. This promotes diversity in the population and helps avoid premature convergence to local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preservation of Useful Genetic Information:**  \n",
    "   Without recombination, mutation alone might randomly disrupt beneficial traits. Recombination allows these features to be retained and reused in the evolutionary process, ensuring that high-quality genetic material is not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Faster Convergence to Optimal Solutions:**  \n",
    "   By producing new individuals with promising genetic combinations, recombination can speed up the search process. It increases the likelihood of generating high-quality solutions early, reducing the number of generations needed to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The **order of genetic operators** is crucial for the performance of evolutionary algorithms. Applying **recombination before mutation** enables:\n",
    "- Better search space coverage\n",
    "- Preservation of advantageous structures\n",
    "- Faster and more reliable convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "These effects contribute to a more robust and efficient genetic algorithm capable of solving complex combinatorial problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem.\n"
